  # The login-item registrations belong to the bundle's own identity, so only
  # the bundle itself can withdraw them, and it does that through its own
  # maintenance entry point. Homebrew runs uninstall directives in a fixed
  # order (Cask::Artifact::AbstractUninstall::ORDERED_DIRECTIVES) and
  # `early_script` is the only one that runs before `quit`, which is what keeps
  # this run from starting a process after the quit has already passed.

  # The home carries the assistant's own data, so it goes only on a zap. The

  # grants, the login item and the coexistence preflight are all keyed on it.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Fermix carries its own engine, so there is nothing else to install.
    An existing Homebrew install's home is adopted in place.
